# Codebase Rules

1. ALWAYS check existing files before creating new ones:

   - Search in the codebase for similar functionality
   - Check recently viewed files
   - Use grep/semantic search to find related code

2. Framework & Architecture:

   - This is an Electron app, NOT Tauri
   - Use ESM modules with .mts extension
   - Follow functional programming patterns
   - Use the existing package manager (check package.json)

3. File Organization:

   - Check ui-svelte/src-main/ for main process code
   - Check ui-svelte/src-renderer/ for renderer process code
   - Respect the existing file structure
   - Don't duplicate functionality

4. Before Making Changes:
   - Read the TypeScript organization guide
   - Check for existing implementations
   - Verify the tech stack being used
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
