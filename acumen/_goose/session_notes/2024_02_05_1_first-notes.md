# Goose Development Session Summary - 2024-02-05

## Project Context

- Working with a fork of https://github.com/block/goose
- Repository correctly set up with:
  - `origin` -> Acumen-Desktop/goose.git
  - `upstream` -> block/goose.git
- Strategy: Build custom UI while maintaining ability to pull upstream updates

## Project Structure Analysis

- Confirmed this is a monorepo with main components in `crates/`
- Current active extensions: only `developer`
- Available but not yet activated extensions:
  - Built-in: memory, computercontroller, jetbrains
  - External: knowledge_graph_memory, fetch, git, tavily, figma

## Custom UI Development Plan

1. Keep all custom code in separate directory to avoid upstream conflicts
2. Created `acumen/` directory for custom development
   - `_goose/` subdirectory for Goose-specific documentation and context

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Decide on UI technology stack
2. [ ] Set up custom UI directory structure
3. [ ] Investigate integration points with Goose core functionality
4. [ ] Consider which additional extensions to enable for development:
   - `memory` for maintaining context
   - `git` for version control integration
   - `figma` if design files will be used

## Development Notes

- Production build requires minimum files:
  - `goose` executable (49MB)
  - `goosed` daemon (46MB)
  - `mcp-server` (5MB)

## Questions for Next Session

1. What UI technology stack would be most appropriate?
2. How to interface with Goose's core functionality?
3. Which extensions should be enabled for development?
