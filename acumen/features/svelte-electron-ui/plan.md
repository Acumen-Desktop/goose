# Svelte Electron UI Migration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the strategy for creating a Svelte-based UI for 'Goose AI', while maintaining the ability to pull updates from upstream. The goal is to create a parallel UI implementation that doesn't interfere with the original React-based implementation.

## Key Principles

1. **Zero Upstream Modifications**: No changes to upstream files to maintain ability to pull updates
2. **Clean Architecture**: Keep frontend (Svelte) and backend (Goose) separate, unlike the React implementation
3. **API-First**: Focus on proper API communication between UI and Goose instances

#### Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure ✓

1. Initialize SvelteKit 2 project with Electron, TailwindCSS, TypeScript ✓
2. Basic Chat UI Components Started ✓
   - Created ChatMessage component with basic styling
   - Created ChatInput component
   - Implemented tool invocations display structure

#### Phase 2: Goose Integration (Current)

1. **API Communication Layer**

   - Created initial API service structure
   - Need to verify actual Goose API endpoints and authentication
   - Understand how to connect to existing Goose instances

2. **Next Steps**:

   - Investigate Goose server/session management
   - Verify correct port and API endpoints for Goose communication
   - Implement proper connection to running Goose instances
   - Consider using Langfuse for debugging/tracing during development

3. **Open Questions/Issues**:
   - How to properly connect to a running Goose instance?
   - What's the correct port/authentication mechanism?
   - Should we implement our own process management or use existing?

#### Phase 3: Feature Implementation

1. Complete Chat Interface

   - Markdown rendering
   - Tool invocations with proper states
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Message history

2. Testing & Documentation
   - Write tests for components
   - Document API integration
   - Usage examples

## Progress (Session 1)

1. ✅ Created basic chat UI with mock data
2. ✅ Implemented basic tool invocations display
3. ✅ Started API service structure
4. ✅ Created Svelte store for state management

## Issues/Blockers

1. Need to verify Goose API endpoints
2. Need to understand proper Goose instance management
3. Need to implement proper error handling

## Next Session Goals

1. Verify Goose API endpoints and authentication
2. Implement proper connection to running Goose instances
3. Get basic message sending/receiving working with a real Goose instance

The main thing we need to figure out next time is how to properly connect to a running Goose instance via its API. We might want to lo
ok more deeply at:

1. The Rust codebase to understand the API endpoints
2. Use Langfuse to trace API calls
3. Or write a simple test client to verify endpoints
